# FIR-Content-Sentiment

## Overview

This repository contains Python code for analyzing sentiment within the context of FIRs (First Information Reports) which I developed during my internship at the National Informatics Centre (NIC), Delhi. It aims to extract and classify the sentiment expressed within FIR text, specifically removing stop words and identifying the geographical location of the incidents reported. 
## Key Features

FIR-specific sentiment analysis: Tailored to the unique language and context of FIRs.
Incorporation of context: Considers the overall context of the FIR to enhance sentiment analysis accuracy.
Customizable sentiment categories: Ability to adjust sentiment categories based on specific needs.
Output format: Generates sentiment scores or labels for each FIR text.
## Installation
