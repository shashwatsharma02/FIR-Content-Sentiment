       "      <th>Statement of Inspr. Anil Kumar No. D-336 PIS no. 16000115 Traffic unit Toda Pur. It is submitted that I am posted in Traffic Unit. In the month of June 2014 I had been marked a complaint of Sh.Ravi Sharma regarding   Stickers Racket  running in Delhi. The contents of the complaint are as follows:- being a common man I want to inform you that this matter is of slap to Delhi Traffic police. I want to inform you that LGV HTV LIKE TATA 407 ICER etc.vehicles are using stickers (marka) on them which is of the name of KRISHNA. The persons involved in this scam is KRISHNA itself whose phone number are 1234568558 3245654581. The vehicles having very high load and having this sticker attached below on it were not stopped by any officer of Delhi traffic police. This sticker is being used in different routes....such as Shahdara Narela bawana bye pass Wazirabad kapaseda mahipalpur Dhaula kuan sanjay Gandhi shastri nagar etc..i.e. Being used in whole Delhi.  On the complaint of Sh. Ravi Sharma marked to me I had conducted enquiry and had checked many commercial vehicles for the verification of the allegations mentioned in the complaint from 13.06.14 to 17.06.14. During checking of commercial vehicles I found some vehicles having the stickers of Hare Rama Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Gulati Motors and PETS. Thereafter I stopped such type of commercial vehicles near Alipur toll tax interrogated the drivers of these vehicles and also recorded their statements. From the statements of the drivers of these commercial vehicles and local enquiry it was revealed that the stickers of Hare Rama Hare Krishna and PETS etc. are used by various Transporters so that they may not be stopped by the traffic police on visible violation of traffic rules which shows that some Transporters have hatched a conspiracy with traffic police personnel to cause wrongful loss to the Govt. by not paying the traffic fine in case of traffic violation. Hence an offence of cheating criminal conspiracy and misconduct on the part of traffic police by abusing their position for pecuniary advantage and transporters using the above mentioned stickers for wrongful gain to them is made out. It is therefore requested that legal action against such erring transporters and traffic police personnel may kindly be taken as per law.

       "Statement of Inspr. Anil Kumar No. D-336 PIS no. 16000115 Traffic unit Toda Pur. It is submitted that I am posted in Traffic Unit. In the month of June 2014 I had been marked a complaint of Sh.Ravi Sharma regarding   Stickers Racket  running in Delhi. The contents of the complaint are as follows:- being a common man I want to inform you that this matter is of slap to Delhi Traffic police. I want to inform you that LGV HTV LIKE TATA 407 ICER etc.vehicles are using stickers (marka) on them which is of the name of KRISHNA. The persons involved in this scam is KRISHNA itself whose phone number are 1234568558 3245654581. The vehicles having very high load and having this sticker attached below on it were not stopped by any officer of Delhi traffic police. This sticker is being used in different routes....such as Shahdara Narela bawana bye pass Wazirabad kapaseda mahipalpur Dhaula kuan sanjay Gandhi shastri nagar etc..i.e. Being used in whole Delhi.  On the complaint of Sh. Ravi Sharma marked to me I had conducted enquiry and had checked many commercial vehicles for the verification of the allegations mentioned in the complaint from 13.06.14 to 17.06.14. During checking of commercial vehicles I found some vehicles having the stickers of Hare Rama Hare Krishna Krishna Krishna Hare Hare Gulati Motors and PETS. Thereafter I stopped such type of commercial vehicles near Alipur toll tax interrogated the drivers of these vehicles and also recorded their statements. From the statements of the drivers of these commercial vehicles and local enquiry it was revealed that the stickers of Hare Rama Hare Krishna and PETS etc. are used by various Transporters so that they may not be stopped by the traffic police on visible violation of traffic rules which shows that some Transporters have hatched a conspiracy with traffic police personnel to cause wrongful loss to the Govt. by not paying the traffic fine in case of traffic violation. Hence an offence of cheating criminal conspiracy and misconduct on the part of traffic police by abusing their position for pecuniary advantage and transporters using the above mentioned stickers for wrongful gain to them is made out. It is therefore requested that legal action against such erring transporters and traffic police personnel may kindly be taken as per law.
